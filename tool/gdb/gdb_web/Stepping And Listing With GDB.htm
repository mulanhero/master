<h2><a id="steppingthroughyourprogram">Stepping through your program</a></h2>

<p>One thing that is good to know is the exact sequence of execution of your program, especially through loops and conditional
branches. If the program is not too large, you can follow it easily by executing one line at a time.</p>

<p>There are two commands used to step through your program:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>step</b>:
</dt><dd>Execute a single line in the program.  If the current statement calls a function, the function is single stepped.
</dd><dt><b>next</b>:
</dt><dd>Execute a single line in the program but treat function calls as a single line.  This command is used to skip over function calls.
</dd></dl>

<p>Since C statements like <code>printf()</code> and <code>scanf()</code> are functions themselves, if you <i>step</i> through all your
program (as opposed to <i>next</i>, you'll find yourself stepping through glibc, the standard C library (which is probably
<i>not</i> what you want!).  Good debugging makes use of <code>next</code> mostly.  If you really want to step through a function
call, it's best to set a breakpoint there and then you can use <code>next</code> from inside the function.</p>

<p>To execute the next statement, type:</p>

<pre class="demo">	step
</pre>

<p>Each time you type a <i>step</i> command, gdb will then list the line that it is about to execute, with the line number on
the left, so you can see what's about to happen before it happens.</p>

<h2><a id="findingoutwhereyouareandlistingsourcecode">Finding out where you are and listing source code</a></h2>

<p>To find out where you are at any time, type the command:</p>

<pre class="demo">	where</pre>

<p>This will show you the current line number.  For example, a line like this:</p>

<pre class="demo">	#0  foo () at foo.f:12</pre>

<p>shows that the execution of our program is currently at a location that corresponds to line 12 in the Fortran
source file, foo.f.</p>

<p>You can display a few lines of your source program around the current location by using the command:</p>

<pre class="demo">	list</pre>

<p>This will list 10 lines of source roughly centred on your current line number.  If you haven't started to debug yet, it will
list the first 10 lines of source code.  If you type list again, it'll print the next 10 lines of source code.  You can also
type:</p>

<pre class="demo">	list 25</pre>

<p>and this will list 10 lines of source code centred on line 25.  Typing list again will list the next 10 lines of source code.
You can also specify a range of lines to be listed. For example, to list lines 10 through 24 in the current program, you'd
type:</p>

<pre class="demo">	list 10,24</pre>

<p>If there is a function in your program named <code>endpoints()</code>, you can list 10 lines centred on the start of
<code>endpoints()</code> by:</p>

<pre class="demo">	list endpoints</pre>

<p>If you're listing lines and decide you want to see the 10 lines previous to the 10 lines you just displayed:</p>

<pre class="demo">	list -</pre>

<p>Suppose you set a breakpoint:</p>

<pre class="demo">	break 55</pre>

<p>and gdb responds with:</p>

<pre class="demo">	Breakpoint 1 at 0x8048540: file program3.c, line 55.</pre>

<p>You can list the lines centred around that address by specifying the asterisk (for address).  It will list the 10 lines
centred around the source code line containing that address.</p>

<pre class="demo">	list *0x8048540</pre>
