ContainerExecutor			Description
DefaultContainerExecutor	The default executor which YARN uses to manage container execution. The container process has the same Unix user as the NodeManager.
LinuxContainerExecutor		Supported only on GNU/Linux, this executor runs the containers as the user who submitted the application. 
							It requires all user accounts to be created on the cluster nodes where the containers are launched. 
							It uses a setuid executable that is included in the Hadoop distribution. 
							The NodeManager uses this executable to launch and kill containers. 
							The setuid executable switches to the user who has submitted the application and launches or kills the containers. 
							For maximum security, this executor sets up restricted permissions and user/group ownership of 
							local files and directories used by the containers such as the shared objects, jars, intermediate files, log files etc. 
							Particularly note that, because of this, except the application owner and NodeManager, no other user can access any of the local files/directories including those localized as part of the distributed cache.
