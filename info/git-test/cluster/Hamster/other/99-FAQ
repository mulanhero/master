1. why m-n = 0 when n=200 or n =500? (num_of_nodes = 22)
Because n >> number_of_nodes, the number of allocated container on each nodes is always larger than 2, 
Thus no container needed to be returned.

2. why opal_output(0, ) on console?
Because log fetcher will not fetch such info from  HNP log on HDFS if the job is successfully finished.
So we have to check the output from HNP log on HDFS.

3. Why we can not get the MPI job's output using 'tail -f /tmp/logs/...' from HNP's containers log?
Because a) the the MPI job's output is printed by rank = 0
        b) there is no IOF between rank=0 and HNP, so HNP will not print the output
        c) rank = 0 's output and HNP's output will uploaded to HDFS
