Allow to limit the network bandwidth for specific process containers (cgroups)
imposing additional delays in the sockets' sendmsg()/recvmsg() calls made by
those processes that exceed the limits defined in the control group filesystem.

Example:
  # mkdir /dev/cgroup
  # mount -t cgroup -onet net /dev/cgroup
  # cd /dev/cgroup
  # mkdir foo
  --> the cgroup foo has been created
  # /bin/echo $$ > foo/tasks
  # /bin/echo 1024 > foo/net.tcp
  # /bin/echo 2048 > foo/net.tot
  # sh
  --> the subshell 'sh' is running in cgroup "foo" that has a maximum network
      bandwidth for TCP traffic of 1MB/s and 2MB/s for total network
      activities.
