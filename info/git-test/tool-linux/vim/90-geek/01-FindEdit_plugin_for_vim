Sometime you don't remember the path to the file you want to open, but you 
remember or know the file name. If you are running on vim, and find yourself 
in the same trouble, this plugin I made would help.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
command! -nargs=? Findedit :call s:Findedit(<f-args>)
function! s:Findedit(...)
  let target = a:1
  let root = "."
  let cwd = getcwd()
  let relpath = ".."
  while cwd != "/"
    let basename = fnamemodify(cwd, ":t")
    let dirname = fnamemodify(cwd, ":h")
    if basename == "cdb-pg"
      let root = relpath
      break
    endif
    let cwd = dirname
    let relpath = relpath . "/.."
  endwhile
""  let foo = append(0, cwd)
  let dest = system("find " . root . " -not -name '.*' | grep '" . target . "' | head -n 1")
  let dest = fnamemodify(dest, ":.")
  exec 'e ' . dest
endfunction
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Save this as ~/.vim/plugin/findedit.vim and restart your vim. 
Type :Find <filename> and you'll open what you want. 
The way it works is run the "find" command and grep it then 
open the first file found in the command chain. So if you want 
to open analyze.c, maybe cdb-pg/src/backend/commands/analyze.c 
is not what you want, but it may be actually cdb-pg/src/backend/parser/analyze.c. 
In that case, try ":Find parser/analyze.c". In addition, this script try to find 
the root directory of cdb2 branch by finding cdb-pg directory, so you can open 
5.0.json by simple file name even though you are sitting in cdb-pg.
Enjoy!



I personally like the Command-T plugin for this purpose: https://github.com/wincent/Command-T.
