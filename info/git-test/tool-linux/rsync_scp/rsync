So what is unique about the rsync command?

It can perform differential uploads and downloads (synchronization) of files across the network, transferring only data that has changed. The rsync remote-update protocol allows rsync to transfer just the differences between two sets of files across the network connection.

How do I install rsync?

Use any one of the following commands to install rsync. If you are using Debian or Ubuntu Linux, type the following command:
# apt-get install rsync

OR
$ sudo apt-get install rsync

If you are using Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) / CentOS 4.x or older version, type the following command:
# up2date rsync

RHEL / CentOS 5.x or newer (or Fedora Linux) user type the following command:
# yum install rsync

Always use rsync over ssh

Since rsync does not provide any security while transferring data it is recommended that you use rsync over ssh session. This allows a secure remote connection. Now let us see some examples of rsync command.

Comman rsync command options

--delete : delete files that don't exist on sender (system)
-v : Verbose (try -vv for more detailed information)
-e "ssh options" : specify the ssh as remote shell
-a : archive mode
-r : recurse into directories
-z : compress file data
Task : Copy file from a local computer to a remote server

Copy file from /www/backup.tar.gz to a remote server called openbsd.nixcraft.in
$ rsync -v -e ssh /www/backup.tar.gz jerry@openbsd.nixcraft.in:~

Output:

Password:
sent 19099 bytes  received 36 bytes  1093.43 bytes/sec
total size is 19014  speedup is 0.99
Please note that symbol ~ indicate the users home directory (/home/jerry).

Task : Copy file from a remote server to a local computer

Copy file /home/jerry/webroot.txt from a remote server openbsd.nixcraft.in to a local computer's /tmp directory:
$ rsync -v -e ssh jerry@openbsd.nixcraft.in:~/webroot.txt /tmp

Task: Synchronize a local directory with a remote directory

$ rsync -r -a -v -e "ssh -l jerry" --delete /local/webroot openbsd.nixcraft.in:/webroot

Task: Synchronize a remote directory with a local directory

$ rsync -r -a -v -e "ssh -l jerry" --delete openbsd.nixcraft.in:/webroot/ /local/webroot

Task: Synchronize a local directory with a remote rsync server or vise-versa

$ rsync -r -a -v --delete rsync://rsync.nixcraft.in/cvs /home/cvs

OR
$ rsync -r -a -v --delete /home/cvs rsync://rsync.nixcraft.in/cvs

Task: Mirror a directory between my "old" and "new" web server/ftp

You can mirror a directory between my "old" (my.old.server.com) and "new" web server with the command (assuming that ssh keys are set for password less authentication)
$ rsync -zavrR --delete --links --rsh="ssh -l vivek" my.old.server.com:/home/lighttpd /home/lighttpd

Other options - rdiff and rdiff-backup

The rdiff command uses the rsync algorithm. A utility called rdiff-backup has been created which is capable of maintaining a backup mirror of a file or directory over the network, on another server. rdiff-backup stores incremental rdiff deltas with the backup, with which it is possible to recreate any backup point. Next time I will write about these utilities.
