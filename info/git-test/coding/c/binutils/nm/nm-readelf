The standard tool for listing symbols is nm, you can use it simply like this:

nm -g yourLib.so
If you want to see symbols of a C++ library, add the "-C" option which demangle the symbols (it's far more readable demangled).

nm -gC yourLib.so
If your .so file is in elf format, you will have to use readelf program to extract symbol information from the binary.

readelf -Ws /usr/lib/libexample.so
You only should extract those that are defined in this .so file, not in the libraries referenced by it. Seventh column should contain a number in this case. You can extract the corresponding lines with awk:

readelf -Ws /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6 | awk '{print $8}';
Update: Thanks to Pavel Shved and Gaspin, I've updated the answer
