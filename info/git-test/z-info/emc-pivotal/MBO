曹海军(Jimmy Cao)，目前在Pivotal Hadoop团队从事HPC与Hadoop平台的整合工作，之前曾在西安交通大学计算机系任讲师。他的主要研究兴趣包括：高性能计算、集群与网格系统资源管理、网格工作流等。他分别于2003年、2010年从华中科技大学获得计算机科学学士、博士学位。
Jimmy Cao is currently working on the integration of HPC and Hadoop platform in Pivotal Hadoop team. Before joining Pivotal, he was a lecture at XJTU(Xi'an Jiaotong University). His research interests include HPC, Cluster and Grid resource management, Grid workflow. He got the bachelor and PH.D. degree in Computer Science from HUST(Huazhong University of Science and Technology) in 2003 and 2010 respectively.  
Before joining EMC, I had been a Lecture in Xi’an Jiaotong University (XJTU) for two and a half years. There I taught two curriculums, i.e., Linux Kernel Primer and System Programming, and High Performance Cluster Computing. Meanwhile, I led a research team having a cooperative project with Baidu on Hadoop Resource Allocation and Job Scheduling in Multi-processor and Heterogeneous Cluster. Before that, I received Ph.D. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2010. My research topic was the parallel and distributed computing, especially focusing on Cluster and Grid Computing.
