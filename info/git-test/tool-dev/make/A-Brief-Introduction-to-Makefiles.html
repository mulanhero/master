<h1>Makefiles For Everyone</h1>

One of the most widely used tools for aiding in constructing large
projects is the <b>Makefile</b>.  Every software package that needs to
be compiled either comes with a Makefile, or has tools for
automatically constructing an appropriate Makefile.  Unfortunately,
while classes explain the syntax and semantics of programming
languages, very little (if anything!) is said about the Makefile - yet
the Makefile is perhaps the most useful tool available for nearly any
software project.  This document attempts to provide a beginner's
guide to Makefiles, with the focus being on simple examples and a
minimal amount of fuss.

<p>

While a Makefile can be used to do many things, the focus here will be
on the construction of a single executable from a set of C source
files.  The discussion will not delve into the many of the options,
control structures, and special commands that are available - only a
little more than the very basics will be covered. 

<p>
It is assumed that the reader has some familiarity with compiling C code.

<p>

<h2>Background</h2>

A single command such as:
<pre>
gcc -o myprogram myprogram.c
</pre>
is sufficient to compile a simple program into an executable.  It
could be argued that such a simple program really doesn't need a
Makefile at all - and perhaps that is true in most cases.  However, in
many cases more than one source file is needed to create an
executable:
<pre>
gcc -c part1.c
gcc -c part2.c 
gcc -c main.c
gcc -o myprogram part1.o part2.o main.o
</pre>
Suddenly, keeping track of what portions need to be re-compiled before
linking ("Did I change something in part2.c, or was that just in
part1.c?") becomes non-trivial, and gets much worse as the number of
source files increase.

<p>

The idea behind a Makefile is simple: with the single command:
<pre>
make
</pre>
a sequence of commands can be carried out.  As an added bonus,
Makefiles can be taught about the dependencies between the files:
e.g. that if part2.c gets changed, then part2.o needs to be re-built.
The best part is that the Makefile is very good at keeping track of
these sorts of dependencies - in fact, that is what it was designed to
do!

<h2>A Simple Makefile</h2>

Makefiles do not need to be complex, nor scary (although you may have
already encountered some that are down-right <b>ugly</b>, and have
thus been frightened away from Makefiles).  The basics behind
makefiles are actually pretty easy.

<p>

Makefiles consist of a series of <b>rules</b> in a simple flat file
format (i.e. your average ASCII text file).
Each rule is of the form:
<pre>
target: requirements
        target build instructions
</pre>
Note that the <b>target build instructions</b> have a TAB in front of
them - not spaces (Don't ask!).  If you use spaces instead of TABs,
you will get an error message something like:
<pre>
Makefile:2: *** missing separator.  Stop.
</pre>
or
<pre>
"Makefile", line 2: Need an operator
Fatal errors encountered -- cannot continue
</pre>
While there are a few "magical"
characters, the only one to be concerned with at this point is the
":", which separates the target from the requirements.  
<p>
Before <b>target</b> can be built,
all the <b>requirements</b> must be in place.  In other words, the
<b>target</b> depends on the <b>requirements</b>.  Each of those
requirements, however, can be the <b>target</b> of another rule.   If
all the requirements are in place, then the <b>target build
instructions</b> are performed to construct <b>target</b>.  In most
cases, the primary target of a Makefile is defined by the first rule
in the Makefile.  Consider the following makefile:

<pre>
# A simple Makefile

myprogram: main.o part1.o part2.o
      gcc -o myprogram main.o part1.o part2.o

part1.o: part1.c part1.h header.h
      gcc -O -c part1.c

part2.o: part2.c header.h
      gcc -O -c part2.c

main.o: main.c header.h
      gcc -O -c main.c

clean:
      rm -f myprogram main.o part1.o part2.o

</pre>

Since this Makefile describes how to construct a program called
'myprogram', it is not surprising that the rule for 'myprogram' is
also the main target of this Makefile.  For this Makefile, the result
of doing a 'make' will be the construction of 'myprogram'.

The lines:
<pre>
myprogram: main.o part1.o part2.o
      gcc -o myprogram main.o part1.o part2.o
</pre>
indicate that three pieces: main.o, part1.o, and part2.o are required
to construct 'myprogram'.  If main.o does not exist, then 'make'
searches for an appropriate rule to build main.o.  As is seen in the
Makefile, there are additional rules which specify how each of these
three pieces are to be constructed.

Let us consider a small portion of the above in more depth:
<pre>
part1.o: part1.c part1.h header.h
      gcc -O -c part1.c
</pre>
This says that in order to construct part1.o, the files part1.c,
part1.h, and header.h must be present.  These are the
<b>requirements</b> to build the target part1.o.  If those files are
present, then the command to construct part1.o is:
<pre>
      gcc -O -c part1.c
</pre>
As a bonus, part1.o will only be re-built if part1.c, part1.h, or
header.h have changed since the last time part1.o was changed!  'make'
looks at the timestamps on the files to determine what has been
changed, and thus what needs to be re-built according to your makefile
rules.  A change to header.h, however, will rebuild everything, as in
this case header.h is used in each of the C files for this program.

<p>

Since each of the rules in a makefile stand on their own, we could
just do a:
<pre>
make main.o
</pre>
to only perform those rules necessary to build the target main.o.  In
a similar way, a:
<pre>
make clean
</pre>
will invoke the rule:
<pre>
clean:
      rm -f myprogram main.o part1.o part2.o
</pre>
Notice that this rule does not have any requirements, and thus will
simply just remove the 'myprogram' executables, and all of the .o
files associated with it. 
<p>

Rules like these are very handy for performing functions
that are slightly more tedious to do by hand.  Even a rule like:
<pre>
backup: 
      cp -Rp * /some/safe/location
</pre>
could be added to a Makefile so that a simple 'make backup' would copy
all the files from the current directory to the directory
'/some/safe/location'.  

<h2>A More Complex Makefile</h2>

There are many cases where you may wish to change compiler options or
even compilers when building a piece of software.  For example, you
may need to specify '-g' to turn on debugging, or '-O2' to add some
extra optimization.  If those flags are hard-coded as they are in the
simple example, then each instance must be edited in the Makefile.
There is, however, an easier way to handle this - with variables.

<p>

Traditionally, Makefile variables are all upper-case, and are
referenced using ${VAR_NAME}, just like <b>sh</b> or <b>csh</b>
variables.  For example, a common set of compiler flags could be
specified as:
<pre>
CFLAGS = -O2 -DDEBUG=1 -I/usr/X11R6/include
</pre>
and then used as ordinary text substitution (just like #ifdef in C) in:
<pre>
gcc ${CFLAGS} -c main.c
</pre>
Note that variable names are case-sensitive.

<p>

The following Makefile uses a few different varaibles:

<pre>

# A more complex Makefile

CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -O

OBJS = part1.o part2.o main.o

myprogram: ${OBJS}
      ${CC} -o myprogram ${CFLAGS} ${OBJS}

part1.o: part1.c part1.h header.h
      ${CC} ${CFLAGS} -c part1.c

part2.o: part2.c header.h
      ${CC} ${CFLAGS} -c part2.c

main.o: main.c header.h
      ${CC} ${CFLAGS} -c main.c

clean:
      rm -f myprogram ${OBJS}
      @echo "all cleaned up!"

</pre>

Here we find three different variables in use: CC, CFLAGS, and OBJS.  CC is
used to specify the compiler - in this case, 'gcc'.  Each place where
${CC} is found, the contents of the variable CC will be substituted
in.  Thus after the substitutions are done, the line:
<pre>
      ${CC} ${CFLAGS} -c main.c
</pre>
would be:
<pre>
      gcc -O -c main.c
</pre>
Should we wish to
use the default compiler 'cc', the change is as simple as:
<pre>
CC = cc
</pre>
in the Makefile.  The compiler flags are specified CFLAGS.  In this
case, only '-O' is specified.  But should we wish to do some execution
profiling, we may wish to change those options to:
<pre>
CFLAGS = -pg -g
</pre>
Again, by simply making the change in one place, we can change how
<b>all</b> of the source files are compiled.
<p>
The third variable used in this file is OBJS.  In this makefile, this
variable specifies all the object files required to construct the main
program.  While each object file could be specified each place ${OBJ}
is used, it is simpler and cleaner to just specify each object
<b>once</b> in:
<pre>
OBJS = part1.o part2.o main.o
</pre>
and then use OBJS afterwards.  While:
<pre>
OBJS = part1.o part2.o main.o

myprogram: ${OBJS}
      ${CC} -o myprogram ${CFLAGS} ${OBJS}
</pre>
is only slightly easier to maintain than:
<pre>
myprogram: part1.o part2.o main.o
      ${CC} -o myprogram ${CFLAGS} part1.o part2.o main.o
</pre>
the use of variables for these sorts of things becomes much more
important as the number of object files increases.
<p>
Of note in this Makefile is the rule:
<pre>
clean:
      rm -f myprogram ${OBJS}
      @echo "all cleaned up!"
</pre>
This rule has no requirements, and has two target building
instructions.  Each time a
<pre>
make clean
</pre>
is done, the executable file and all the object files will be
removed, and the text "all cleaned up" will be displayed.  
In the general case, 'make' displays the line to be executed before it
performs the line.  The "@" at the beginning of the line (but after
the TAB!) suppresses the displaying of the the line about to be executed.

<h2>What else?</h2>

While Makefiles are mostly used for aiding in building software
packages, they can also be used for other purposes.  For example:
<pre>
mypaper: paper.tex
      latex paper.tex
      latex paper.tex
      dvips paper.dvi
</pre>
could be used to simplify running LaTeX and dvips when writing a paper
using LaTeX.
<p>
A set of simulation runs, and the production of corresponding graphs,
could also be orchestrated with a simple makefile:
<pre>

everything: run1 run2 run3 plots

run1: 
      mysim -o result1.out input_file -parameter1

run2: 
      mysim -o result2.out input_file -parameter2

run3: 
      mysim -o result3.out input_file -parameter3

plots:
      gnuplot plot1.plt
      gnuplot plot2.plt
      gnuplot plot3.plt
</pre>

In short, anything that has a rule-based dependency ordering can be
handled with a Makefile.  

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

The makefiles presented here have been quite trivial - makefiles can
and do get ugly.  However for simple projects, small, readable
makefiles can be constructed, and can be very useful.  For large
projects with ugly makefiles, the makefiles can be incredibly useful.
So the next time you have even a small software project to work on,
save yourself some grief.  Take a few minutes and build yourself a
Makefile.  It will save you wear and tear in the long run.

A more definitive guide to Makefiles is found with:
<pre>
man make
</pre>
although this typically has way more detail than is required to
construct simple makefiles.
