That's not how it's supposed to work. It's not the kernel type that should determine where your libraries go, but the library types themselves - 64-bit .so's go to /usr/lib64, 32-bit to /usr/lib.

You can't have one RPM contain both architectures, the result should be 2 different RPMs, and if I am not mistaken RPM macros should resolve this for you if you use %_libdir.
