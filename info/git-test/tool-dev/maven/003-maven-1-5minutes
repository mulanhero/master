1.	$mvn --version
2. 	Creating a Project
	$mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=my-app \
	-DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
	//here: archetype is plugin, and 'generate' is one of the plugin's goal
	//the goal will generate a 'my-app' which is specified as '-DartifactId=my-app' 
3. 	$cd my-app
4. 	Build the Project
	$mvn package
5. 	exe
	$java -cp target/my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.mycompany.app.App
	Hello World!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. 	the most common default lifecycle phases
1) 	validate
	validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
2)	compile
	compile the source code of the project
3)	test
	test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. 
	These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
4) 	package
	take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, 
	such as a JAR.
5) 	integration-test
	process and deploy the package if necessary into an environment 
	where integration tests can be run
6)	verify
	run any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria
7)	install
	install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency 
	in other projects locally
8)	deploy
	done in an integration or release environment, copies the final package 
	to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
---------------------
	//some phase
	validate
	generate-sources
	process-sources
	generate-resources
	process-resources
	compile
---------------------
2. 	other lifecycle
1)	clean: cleans up artifacts created by prior builds
2)	site: generates site documentation for this project
---------------------
3. 
	$mvn clean dependency:copy-dependencies package
	This command will clean the project, copy dependencies, and package the 
	project (executing all phases up to package, of course).
	//here, clean is phase
	//dependency is plugin, and 'copy-dependencies' is a goal
	//package is a plugin
---------------------
4.	Generating the Site
	$mvn site
	This phase generates a site based upon information on the project's pom. 
	You can look at the documentation generated under target/site.
