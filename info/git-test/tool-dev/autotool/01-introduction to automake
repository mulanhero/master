1. automake
The automake program generates standard makefile templates (named
Makefile.in) from high-level build specification files (named Makefile.am).

In fact, you can write your Makefile.am files so all they contain
is ordinary make script, and the resulting makefiles will work just fine. 

2. aclocal
The current recommendation
is to create a directory in the project root directory called m4 and
add macros as individual .m4 files to it. All files in this directory will be gathered
into aclocal.m4 before Autoconf processes configure.ac.
