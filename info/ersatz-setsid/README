Synopsis:

  setsid program [arg...]

Description:

  setsid runs a program in a new session.

  This is an ersatz setsid command for those Unixes (e.g. Mac OS X)
  that don't have one.  It's intended to work like (or enough like)
  the one from the util-linux-ng package that I can run the RabbitMQ
  test suite as of Summer 2011 on a Mac OS X dev machine.

  The description below is excerpted from the setsid(1) Linux man page
  for the setsid included in the util-linux-ng package.  This setsid
  knockoff works enough like that one for my purposes (which at the
  time were only being able to run the version of the RabbitMQ tests that
  were current as of the summer of 2011 on a Mac OS X development box).
  It isn't guaranteed to be absolutely identical in all respects,
  having been written from a quick read of the Linux original's man
  page, rather than by porting its source.
